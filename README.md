Description:
============
Famous and Infamous is a program/game where the computer guesses player's famous or infamous person's
name.
The tree has nodes that stores the questions in a binary tree. When the game is played, the player
is prompted by a series of questions, until the program generates the a question to the item that the player may be thinking
of. If the appropriate figure is found, the user is prompted to replay the game. If the correct question
has not been asked? Then the player is prompted to enter the figure that he/she was thinking of, and 
the question that may lead to that figure. This new information is then saved to the tree.

The Assignments for this program related to adding new features:

(1) The function to Save the game to a file
(2) The function to load the game from a file
(3) To Save the game into a profile, and to select 
    and load the profile upon the beginning of a new game.
